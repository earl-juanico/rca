## Model information

### Model summary

PaliGemma 2 is an update of the [PaliGemma](https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07726)
vision-language model (VLM) which incorporates the capabilities of the
[Gemma 2](https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00118) models. The PaliGemma family of
models is inspired by [PaLI-3](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.09199) and based on
open components such as the [SigLIP](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.15343) vision
model and [Gemma 2](https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00118) language models. It takes
both image and text as input and generates text as output, supporting multiple
languages. It is designed for class-leading fine-tune performance on a wide
range of vision-language tasks such as image and short video caption, visual
question answering, text reading, object detection and object segmentation.

#### Model architecture

PaliGemma 2 is the composition of a
[Transformer decoder](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762) and a
[Vision Transformer image encoder](https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.11929).
The text decoder is initialized from
[Gemma 2](https://ai.google.dev/gemma/docs/base) in the 2B, 9B, and 27B
parameter sizes. The image encoder is initialized from
[SigLIP-So400m/14](https://colab.research.google.com/github/google-research/big_vision/blob/main/big_vision/configs/proj/image_text/SigLIP_demo.ipynb).
Similar to the original PaliGemma model, PaliGemma 2 is trained following the
[PaLI-3](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.09199) recipes.

#### Inputs and outputs

*   **Input:** Image and text string, such as a prompt to caption the image, or
    a question.
*   **Output:** Generated text in response to the input, such as a caption of
    the image, an answer to a question, a list of object bounding box
    coordinates, or segmentation codewords.

### Model data

#### Pre-train datasets

PaliGemma 2 is pre-trained on the following mixture of datasets:

*   **WebLI:** [WebLI (Web Language Image)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.06794) is
    a web-scale multilingual image-text dataset built from the public web. A
    wide range of WebLI splits are used to acquire versatile model capabilities,
    such as visual semantic understanding, object localization,
    visually-situated text understanding, and multilinguality.
*   **CC3M-35L:** Curated English image-alt_text pairs from webpages
    ([Sharma et al., 2018](https://aclanthology.org/P18-1238/)). We used the
    [Google Cloud Translation API](https://cloud.google.com/translate) to
    translate into 34 additional languages.
*   **VQ²A-CC3M-35L/VQG-CC3M-35L:** A subset of VQ2A-CC3M
    ([Changpinyo et al., 2022a](https://aclanthology.org/2022.naacl-main.142/)),
    translated into the same additional 34 languages as CC3M-35L, using the
    [Google Cloud Translation API](https://cloud.google.com/translate).
*   **OpenImages:** Detection and object-aware questions and answers
    ([Piergiovanni et al. 2022](https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.04372)) generated by
    handcrafted rules on the [OpenImages dataset].
*   **WIT:** Images and texts collected from Wikipedia
    ([Srinivasan et al., 2021](https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.01913)).

[OpenImages dataset]: https://storage.googleapis.com/openimages/web/factsfigures_v7.html
PaliGemma 2 is based on Gemma 2, and you can find information on the
pre-training datasets for Gemma 2 in the
[Gemma 2 model card](https://ai.google.dev/gemma/docs/model_card_2).

#### Data responsibility filtering

The following filters are applied to WebLI, with the goal of training PaliGemma
2 on safe and responsible data:

*   **Pornographic image filtering:** This filter removes images deemed to be of
    pornographic nature.
*   **Text safety filtering:** We identify and filter out images that are paired
    with unsafe text. Unsafe text is any text deemed to contain or be about
    child sexual abuse imagery (CSAI), pornography, vulgarities, or is otherwise
    offensive.
*   **Text toxicity filtering:** We further use the [Perspective
    API](https://perspectiveapi.com/) to identify and filter out images that are
    paired with text deemed insulting, obscene, hateful or otherwise toxic.
*   **Text personal information filtering:** We filtered certain personal
    information and other sensitive data using the [Cloud Data Loss Prevention
    (DLP) API](https://cloud.google.com/security/products/dlp) to protect the
    privacy of individuals. Identifiers such as social security numbers and
    [other sensitive information types] were removed.
*   **Additional methods:** Filtering based on content quality and safety in
    line with our policies and practices.

[other sensitive information types]: https://cloud.google.com/sensitive-data-protection/docs/high-sensitivity-infotypes-reference?_gl=1*jg604m*_ga*ODk5MzA3ODQyLjE3MTAzMzQ3NTk.*_ga_WH2QY8WWF5*MTcxMDUxNTkxMS4yLjEuMTcxMDUxNjA2NC4wLjAuMA..&_ga=2.172110058.-899307842.1710334759

## Use in Transformers

You can use the following prompt templates to perform different tasks: 
- `"cap {lang}"`: Raw short caption (from WebLI-alt)
- `"caption {lang}"`: Nice, COCO-like short captions
- `"describe {lang}"`: Longer, more descriptive captions
- `"ocr"`: Optical character recognition
- `"answer {lang} {question}"`: Question answering about the image contents
- `"question {lang} {answer}"`: Question generation for a given answer
- `"detect {object} ; {object}"`: Locate listed objects in an image and return the bounding boxes for those objects
- `"segment {object}"`: Locate the area occupied by the object in an image to create an image segmentation for that object


```python
from transformers import (
    PaliGemmaProcessor,
    PaliGemmaForConditionalGeneration,
)
from transformers.image_utils import load_image
import torch

model_id = "google/paligemma2-3b-mix-448"

url = "https://huggingface.co/datasets/huggingface/documentation-images/resolve/main/transformers/tasks/car.jpg"
image = load_image(url)

model = PaliGemmaForConditionalGeneration.from_pretrained(model_id, torch_dtype=torch.bfloat16, device_map="auto").eval()
processor = PaliGemmaProcessor.from_pretrained(model_id)

prompt = "describe en"
model_inputs = processor(text=prompt, images=image, return_tensors="pt").to(torch.bfloat16).to(model.device)
input_len = model_inputs["input_ids"].shape[-1]

with torch.inference_mode():
    generation = model.generate(**model_inputs, max_new_tokens=100, do_sample=False)
    generation = generation[0][input_len:]
    decoded = processor.decode(generation, skip_special_tokens=True)
    print(decoded)
```

Here is a [notebook](https://github.com/merveenoyan/smol-vision/blob/main/Fine_tune_PaliGemma.ipynb)
that showcases fine-tuning PaliGemma 2.

## Implementation information

### Hardware

PaliGemma 2 was trained using the latest generation of Tensor Processing Unit
(TPU) hardware (TPUv5e).

### Software

Training was completed using [JAX](https://github.com/google/jax),
[Flax](https://github.com/google/flax),
[TFDS](https://github.com/tensorflow/datasets) and
[`big_vision`](https://github.com/google-research/big_vision).

JAX allows researchers to take advantage of the latest generation of hardware,
including TPUs, for faster and more efficient training of large models.

TFDS is used to access datasets and Flax is used for model architecture. The
PaliGemma 2 fine-tune code and inference code are released in the `big_vision`
GitHub repository.

## Evaluation information

### Benchmark results

In order to verify the transferability of PaliGemma 2 to a wide variety of
academic tasks, we fine-tune the pretrained models on each task. We report results on
different resolutions to provide an impression of which tasks benefit from
increased resolution and which tasks benefit from larger models. Importantly, none of these tasks or datasets are part of
the pretraining data mixture, and their images are explicitly removed from the
web-scale pre-training data.

## Ethics and safety

### Evaluation approach

Our evaluation methods include structured ethics and safety evaluations across
relevant content policies, including:

*   Human evaluation on prompts covering child safety, content safety and
    representational harms. See the [Gemma model
    card](https://ai.google.dev/gemma/docs/model_card#evaluation_approach) for
    more details on evaluation approach, but with image captioning and visual
    question answering setups.
*   Image-to-Text benchmark evaluation: Benchmark against relevant academic
    datasets such as FairFace Dataset ([Karkkainen et al.,
    2021](https://arxiv.org/abs/1908.04913)).

### Evaluation results

*   The human evaluation results of ethics and safety evaluations are within
    acceptable thresholds for meeting [internal
    policies](https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-uniblog-publish-prod/documents/2023_Google_AI_Principles_Progress_Update.pdf#page=11)
    for categories such as child safety, content safety and representational
    harms.
*   On top of robust internal evaluations, we also use the Perspective API
    (threshold of 0.8) to measure toxicity, profanity, and other potential
    issues in the generated captions for images sourced from the FairFace
    dataset. We report the maximum and median values observed across subgroups
    for each of the perceived gender, ethnicity, and age attributes.

## Usage and limitations

### Intended usage

Open Vision Language Models (VLMs) have a wide range of applications across
various industries and domains. The following list of potential uses is not
comprehensive. The purpose of this list is to provide contextual information
about the possible use-cases that the model creators considered as part of model
training and development. Prohibited uses of Gemma models are outlined in the
[Gemma Prohibited Use Policy](https://ai.google.dev/gemma/prohibited_use_policy).

Fine-tune on specific vision-language task:

*   The pre-trained models can be fine-tuned on a wide range of vision-language
    tasks such as: image captioning, short video caption, visual question
    answering, text reading, object detection and object segmentation.
*   The pre-trained models can be fine-tuned for specific domains such as remote
    sensing question answering, visual questions from people who are blind,
    science question answering, describe UI element functionalities.
*   The pre-trained models can be fine-tuned for tasks with non-textual outputs
    such as bounding boxes or segmentation masks.

Vision-language research:

*   The pre-trained models and fine-tuned models can serve as a foundation for
    researchers to experiment with VLM techniques, develop algorithms, and
    contribute to the advancement of the field.

### Ethical considerations and risks

The development of vision-language models (VLMs) raises several ethical
concerns. In creating an open model, we have carefully considered the following:

*   Bias and Fairness
    *   VLMs trained on large-scale, real-world image-text data can reflect
        socio-cultural biases embedded in the training material. These models
        underwent careful scrutiny, input data pre-processing described and
        posterior evaluations reported in this card.
*   Misinformation and Misuse
    *   VLMs can be misused to generate text that is false, misleading, or
        harmful.
    *   Guidelines are provided for responsible use with the model, see the
        [Responsible Generative AI Toolkit](https://ai.google.dev/responsible).
*   Transparency and Accountability
    *   This model card summarizes details on the models' architecture,
        capabilities, limitations, and evaluation processes.
    *   A responsibly developed open model offers the opportunity to share
        innovation by making VLM technology accessible to developers and
        researchers across the AI ecosystem.

Risks identified and mitigations:

*   **Perpetuation of biases:** It's encouraged to perform continuous monitoring
    (using evaluation metrics, human review) and the exploration of de-biasing
    techniques during model training, fine-tuning, and other use cases.
*   **Generation of harmful content:** Mechanisms and guidelines for content
    safety are essential. Developers are encouraged to exercise caution and
    implement appropriate content safety safeguards based on their specific
    product policies and application use cases.
*   **Misuse for malicious purposes:** Technical limitations and developer and
    end-user education can help mitigate against malicious applications of LLMs.
    Educational resources and reporting mechanisms for users to flag misuse are
    provided: see the [Responsible Generative AI Toolkit](https://ai.google.dev/responsible).
    Prohibited uses of Gemma models are outlined in the
    [Gemma Prohibited Use Policy](https://ai.google.dev/gemma/prohibited_use_policy).
*   **Privacy violations:** Models were trained on data filtered to remove
    certain personal information and sensitive data. Developers are encouraged
    to adhere to privacy regulations with privacy-preserving techniques.

### Limitations

*   Most limitations inherited from the underlying Gemma 2 models still apply:
    *   VLMs are better at tasks that can be framed with clear prompts and
        instructions. Open-ended or highly complex tasks might be challenging.
    *   Natural language is inherently complex. VLMs might struggle to grasp
        subtle nuances, sarcasm, or figurative language.
    *   VLMs generate responses based on information they learned from their
        training datasets, but they are not knowledge bases. They may generate
        incorrect or outdated factual statements.
    *   VLMs rely on statistical patterns in language and images. They might
        lack the ability to apply common sense reasoning in certain situations.
*   PaliGemma 2 was designed first and foremost to serve as a general
    pre-trained model for fine-tuning to specialized tasks. Hence, its "out of
    the box" or "zero-shot" performance might lag behind models designed
    specifically for general purpose use.
*   PaliGemma 2 is not a multi-turn chatbot. It is designed for a single round
    of image and text input.
